# Yes, Another Stupid Webapp
Web remake of critically(bias) acclaimed mobile game, "HACKERS The game".

The app this project is based on is still available today. Please give it a shot- its great and I'm tired of raiding the same rotation of 10 people that still play it today.

# Libraries used

### Frontend
Three.js for rendering
three-globe for the globe (no way am I redoing allat in blender)

### Backend
- Google App Script webapp (process requests)
- Google sheets (database)

> While worth noting both of these are free, remaining within the usage quota means putting an unsafe amount of trust in clients to minimize server-side read/write calls. Because of this, there is a purposeful lack of verification when receiving data from game clients by design.
